3.1.1.12 Advanced exceptions – the LAB

Estimated time
    15 minutes

Level of difficulty
    Low

Objectives
    improving the student's skills in operating with different kinds of exceptions.
    Scenario
    Try to extend the check list script to handle more different checks, all reported as RocketNotReady exceptions.
    Add your own checks for: batteries and circuits.
   
    
class RocketNotReadyError(Exception):
    pass

        print("\tThe pilot's name is", crew[1])
        print("\tThe mechanic's name is", crew[2])
        print("\tThe navigator's name is", crew[3])
    except IndexError as e:
        raise RocketNotReadyError('Crew is incomplete') from e
